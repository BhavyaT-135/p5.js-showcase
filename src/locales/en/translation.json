 "AboutIntro":"Introducing Showcase, created by [Ashley Kang](https://ashleykang.dev) in 2019 and currently curated by [Connie Liu](https://connieliu0.github.io). We're celebrating how people are using p5.js to make creative work, learning, and open source more interesting and inclusive. Together, we make community. During Summer 2019, we asked a few creators to share more about how they've used p5.js through different projects and pieces.",

        "answer1":"I'm a creative coder and designer, a [School of Machines, Making & Make-Believe diversity scholarship recipient](https://schoolofma.org/), and just a curious creature.\n\nI was taking a course at the [School of Machines](https://schoolofma.org/bots.html) in Berlin this summer called \"Bots and Machine Learning,\" mainly taught by [Yining Shi](https://1023.io/).",
        "answer2":"I used p5.js to work on the visual part of the game. The animation sprites for Airi and the ghosts were drawn on an iPad app called [Pixaki](https://rizer.co/pixaki/) and then integrated into [p5.play](https://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/) code. I mainly used examples at p5.play as a reference.\n\nFor the endless scrolling background, I found a p5 sketch by [chjno](https://editor.p5js.org/chjno/sketches/ByZlypKWM). I set a condition so whenever the word \"pew\" or a mouse click was detected, the scrolling speed would change to make an illusion of Airi flying up. When the user does not do anything, the scrolling speed is negative, which makes it look like Airi is falling down.\n\nFor sound recognition, I used [Google's Teachable Machine 2](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/io19) (currently, there is a beta version not available in public yet, but it will be very soon!). I added around 120 samples of my classmates saying the word \"pew\" with different intonations and 80 samples of background noise to train it. Then I integrated the model into the game with [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/).",
        "answer3":"I really love how easily you can create, manipulate, and delete HTML blocks and classes with the p5.js library via [createDiv()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/createDiv), [addClass()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Element/addClass) etc. But my most favorite function is [draw()](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/draw), since this is where you create magic.",
        "answer4":"There were a lot of challenges simply because p5.js was something new to me. I did not work much with JavaScript in general before. Reading documentation and searching for similar examples helped a lot.",
        "answer5":"Check out School of Machines' courses! They try hard to connect the most creative people in the world and they do it well so far ❤."

            "answer2":"I used p5.js in this project to generate the sine wave and lerp (linear interpolation) formulas and display the visuals in the p5.js Web Editor. I then used a feature in my code that exported my programmed graphic into an [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) file. I needed an SVG file to give to the plotter—an [AxiDraw V3](https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/846)—so that it understood where to draw the lines that I programmed. I sent this information to the plotter with a program called [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)!",
